I have had the smae conversation with several developers over the last week.  So you know what that means, **BLOG POST**!  There seems to be this idea that the only way to contirbute to Open Source Software (OSS) is by submiting massive PR's with thousands of lines of improved code.  I am here to tell you, while I appreciate those PR's and people helping with bugs and features, those are not the only contributions

## What is a contribution

#### A conversation
So much can be exposed through conversation.  Often we make tools to solve problems.  As a maintiner, the problems we need to solve may not fit your use case (although generally they do if you are consuming your own dog food).  
- Answering Questions
- Asking relevant questions
- Identifying and Reporting issues
- Requesting features
- Promoting the framework
- Test beta packages

## Contribute

After reading this I hope you understand how you can better support frameworks your consume.  While I want your code, I prefer your investment in the product.  Then we can work together as a community and make better software for ourselves!
